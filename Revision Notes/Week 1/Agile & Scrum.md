**Sprint backlog** will consist of user stories that are generated during sprint meetings and will be outside of the original intended scope of the project. These user stories will be handled at a later date

**Product backlog** will consist of user stories already decided upon by the team and does not change. User stories will be added in a priority based order to the product backlog based on value and effort.

An **epic** is a story covering the full users' needs for a project. User stories are often used in order to break down requirements for a project into smaller and more easily understandable steps using the epic. It is important to refine down these stories

As [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason]



A good user-story is built up from the traits - I.N.V.E.S.T.

- **I**ndependent
- **N**egotiable
- **V**aluable
- **E**stimable
- **S**mall
- **T**estable

Three amigos methodology involves using a meeting involving the three different roles in development (Tester, Developer and User) in order to obtain a better understanding of what is required by the user.

**Gherkin Scenario:**
- Given -
- When -
- Then -

The gherkin scenario can be applied to user stories in order to ensure that user requirements are met by the final product.
