# Dockerization

Dockerization is the process of creating a docker image for your application, including any necessary code, libraries or dependencies. This allows you to create multiple eninviornment from the single image allowing.

## Types of Deployment

Deployment is the different kind of ways that code or software is delivered to the end-user. The three main types of deployment include:

**Executable** deployment is when you directly compile your code and deploy it as an .exe (Windows) for example

**Dockerization** deployment is when you create a docker image from your code, where it can then be deployed to a container locally or over a network.

**Library** deployment is when you create a piece of code which can then be imported into further projects.
