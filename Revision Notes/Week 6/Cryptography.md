# Cryptology: Cryptography and Cryptoanalysis

## Cryptography

Cryptography is a way of altering data in such a way that it cannot be read (encryption), as well as back to a readable format again utilizing a decryption key (decryption). This is often used during communications in order to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to information.

## Ciphers

A cipher is an algorithm that consists of a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure when encrypting and decrypting messages. Some of the types of ciphers include:

- **Caesar Ciphers** will swap out letters for different letters relative to the alphabet.
- **Substitution Ciphers** will swap out letters for different letters, numbers and symbols based on the letter being swapped.
- **Transposition Cipers** will rearrange letters rather than swapping them.

## Encryption Classes

There are two classes of encryption used to provide data confidentiality. These two classes differe in how they utilize keys:

- **Symmetric encryption** is an encryption algorithm that uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt.
  - Block Ciphers works on "blocks" made up of 64 bits in order to perform encryption
  - Stream Ciphers works on a single bit at a time in order to perform encryption.
- **Asymmetric encryption** is an encryption algorithm that utilizes a unique key for encryption and decryption.
