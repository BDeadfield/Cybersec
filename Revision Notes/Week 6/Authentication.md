## Token-Based Authentication

A token is used to store the user's state on the client machine. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a way of securely transmitting information. The anatomy of a JWT token comprises three parts seperated by dots. The three parts include the JWT header, the JWT payload, and it's signature respectively (header.payload.signature). The JWT Header is a Base64 URL-encoded JSON object. The JWT Header contains details on the algorithm used for encryption. Base64 is comprised of lowercase and uppercase letters, Base10 numbers as well as addition and subtraction functions (26 + 26 + 10 + 2). The JWT payload contains pieces of information about the user account. The JWT signature is comprised of the hashes for the JWT header and payload along with a secret key.
