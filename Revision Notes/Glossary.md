# Glossary

**Asset**
: An asset is something that we want to protect, and can include data, software, hardware and more.

**Vulnerability**
: A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in protection efforts, which could lead to potential exploitation.

**Exploit**
: An exploit is a way a user can leverage a vulnerability in order to perform a malicious action.

**Threat**
: A threat is a hypothetical issue / problem that could potential arise in the future.

**Risk**
: A risk is the potentiality of an issue occurring. Risk assessment methodologies are often used in order to determine a rating for risks. This risk is usually calculated by considering several factors, such as: assets, threats and vulnerabilities.

**GIT**
: GIT is a software that can be used to keep track of file changes and project snapshots. Due to this, it is often used for version control.

**Markdown**
: Markdown is a lightweight mark-up language utilized for creating formatted plain-text files. This is often used in web design as a text-to-HTML-conversion tool.

**Virutalisation**
: Virtualistion is the process of seperating software from hardware in a system. Allowing for multiple operating systems to be running simultaneously on the same hardware for example.

**Container**
: A container is a lightweight piece of software that bundles code, configuration and dependecies into a single image without the requirement for an operating system. Usually used to create multiple seperate development environments

**LAN**
: A LAN consists of several devices interconnected to each other, often in a small perimeter such as a home or office.

**WAN**
: A WAN consists of numerous LANs connected together via the internet. This connection usually comes in the form of a service provided by a network provider, however this is not necessary (some large enterprises will utilize WAN to connect several premises.)

**Firewall**
: A firewall is a system, or group of systems, that enforces an access control policy between networks. Firewalls prevent the exposure of sensitive hosts, resources and applications to untrusted users by sanitizing protocol flow, preventing the exploitation of protocol flaws.

**Intrusion Prevention System**
: Intrusion Prevention System is a control system that can not only detect intrusions, but can also accept or reject packets based on a configured ruleset.

**NAT**
: NAT is a tool used in order to translate private IPv4 addresses (addresses only viable locally) to public IPv4 addresses for usage on the internet.
