# Virtualisation
Virtualisation is the process of separating software from the hardware. This allows for a user to utilize a virtual cable as if it was physical. A similar concept can be applied to operating systems.

## Hypervisor

Hypervisor (also known as Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)) works as an interface between the VMs and a host machine.

Hypervisor allows the user to separate the operating system from the hardware. Allowing for multiple virtual machines to utilize a piece of hardware.

### Types of Hypervisor

**Type 1 Hypervisors** do not utilize an operating system as it comes with it's own software. Due to this, Type 1 Hypervisors are able to put out more performance in comparison to Type 2 Hypervisors.

**Type 2 Hypervisors** will require the user to be running their own operating system in addition to a hypervisor on top. Type 2 Hypervisors are more simplistic as they can be installed on top of any PC's existing OS, as well as allowing for an easier multitasking experience.
